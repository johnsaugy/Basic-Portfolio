    <p> Hello everyone! My name is John Saugy and I am a student in your class. 


    <p> I am originally from Providence, RI and moved to Bethpage, NY (in Long Island, NY) when I was younger. </p>

    <p> I attended school in Upstate NY at SUNY Geneseo, which is about 30 minutes south of Rochester, and an hour east of Buffalo. I graduated in May 2016, with a degree in Business Administratio and a minor in Finance. </p>


    <p> In Sepetember, I moved to down Southern Maryland for and stayed with some relatives. In January, I moved to Alexandria, VA where I currently share a townhouse with 3 other roommates. </p>

      <p> During my spare time I enjoy playing soccer, hockey, skiing, and travelling with friends and family. I look forward to meeting and working with you. Feel free to connect with me on my social media accounts!</p>
